# Puzzle solving search algorithms


## Description
This project is a python implementation of the following search algorithms: **A Star, BFS, DFS, and Greedy Search.**

If you are using the A* or Greedy Search algorithms, you can choose between the following heuristics: **Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance, and Hamming Distance.**

The algorithms are used to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. The blank square is represented by the number 0. The following is an example of a 8-puzzle problem:
